          parameters.
        - "patterns": dictionary with the pattern before processing

        - "optimizer": if *method* is "bayesian", the

          "nelder-mead", a list with the

          parameters scaled to the range [0, 1] of the search space.

    optimize_adaptive_histogram_equalization,
    optimize_bandpass_filter,
    kikuchipy.draw.plot_pattern_processing_result

    Notes
    -----
    Two optimization methods are available:

    - "bayesian": Bayesian optimization based on Gaussian process
      regression, using :class:`bayes_opt.BayesianOptimization` with
      the expected improvement acquisition function. After
      *n_initial_points* random evaluations, each new candidate is
      chosen from a surrogate model of all evaluations so far.

      This requires the optional dependency
      :mod:`bayesian-optimization`.
    - "nelder-mead": local optimization with the Nelder-Mead
      method, using :func:`scipy.optimize.minimize`. The first start is
      the center of the search space, and each of the *n_restarts*
      restarts is from the best parameters so far, slightly perturbed.
      The *n_calls* evaluations are shared between the starts, with
      evaluations left by a start which converges early passed on to
      the next. This method is typically several times faster than
      Bayesian optimization, since choosing each new candidate is
      cheaper, while it might converge to a local maximum.

    Each processing parameter is specified as either:

    - A scalar or string: the value is fixed and not searched.
    - A tuple (low, high): an integer range if both values are integers,
      otherwise a real range. An optional third element sets the scale
      the range is searched on, either "linear" (default) or "log", e.g.
      (1e-4, 5e-3, "log"). A logarithmic scale gives each order of
      magnitude equal weight, which suits ranges spanning several
      orders of magnitude.
    - A list: at least two candidate values to choose between.
    - None: the default of the single step function, which for some
      parameters depends on the pattern size.

    Processing steps preserve the pattern's data type. Adaptive
    histogram equalization gives bad results for patterns with a
    floating point data type.

    To process a full pattern stack with the best parameters, pass
    ``result["parameters"]["remove_dynamic_background"]`` and
    ``result["parameters"]["adaptive_histogram_equalization"]`` to
    :meth:`~kikuchipy.signals.EBSD.remove_dynamic_background` and
    :meth:`~kikuchipy.signals.EBSD.adaptive_histogram_equalization`,
    respectively, and pass
    ``result["parameters"]["bandpass_filter"],`` to
    :func:`~kikuchipy.filters.bandpass_fft_filter` to create the filter
    for :meth:`~kikuchipy.signals.EBSD.fft_filter`. In the latter case,
    remember to pass ``function_domain="frequency", shift=True`` to
    ``fft_filter()``.
